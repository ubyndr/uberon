! Uberon Reference Collection
!
! The GO reference collection is a set of abstracts that can be cited
! in the GO ontologies (e.g. as dbxrefs for term definitions) and
! annotation files (in the Reference column).
!
! The collection houses two main kinds of references; one type are
! descriptions of methods that groups use for ISS, IEA, and ND
! evidence codes; the other type are abstract-style descriptions of
! "GO content" meetings at which substantial changes in the ontologies
! are discussed and made.
!
! data fields for this file:
!
!  go_ref_id: [mandatory; cardinality 1; GO_REF:nnnnnnn]
!  alt_id: [not mandatory; cardinality 0,1,>1; GO_REF:nnnnnnn]
!  title: [mandatory; cardinality 1; free text]
!  authors: [mandatory; cardinality 1; free text??
!            or cardinality 1,>1 and one entry per author?]
!  year: [mandatory, cardinality 1]
!  external_accession: [not mandatory; cardinality 0,1,>1; DB:id]
!  citation: [not mandatory; cardinality 0,1; use for published refs]
!  abstract: [mandatory; cardinality 1; free text]
!  comment: [not mandatory; cardinality 1; free text]
!  is_obsolete: [not mandatory; cardinality 0,1; 'true';
!            if tag is not present, assume that the ref is not obsolete
!            denotes a reference no longer used by the contributing database]
!
!  If a database maintains its own internal reference collection, and
!  has a record that is equivalent to a GO_REF entry, the database's
!  internal ID should be included as an external_accession for the
!  corresponding GO_REF.

go_ref_id: UBERONREF:0000002
title: Phenotype RCN Neural Crest Meeting
authors: 
year: 2012
abstract: The neural crest workshop consists of a combination of domain experts with a variety of expertise (comparative neural crest anatomy, craniofacial, placodal, ENS/PNS, cell typing, etc) and ontologists. The outcome will be a much improved representation of neural crest amongst a number of ontologies including (but not limited to!) the Gene Ontology (GO), Uberon, the vertebrate musculosketal ontology (VAO), mouse anatomy (MA), the cell ontology, human developmental (EHDAA2/FMA), and the Teleost Anatomy Ontology (TAO). The hope is that the participants will form a new community around this work and author a paper together.

title: Obo-anatomy call, 2012-08-17
authors: (Add participants here)
year: 2012
abstract: Decisions reached about axial skeleton: bless a 3 level division into cranial, axial and appendicular. here "axial skeleton" refers to what we have been calling "post-cranial axial skeleton" in uberon (and MA). We can still retain what we had been calling "axial skeleton" as a grouping class, but it can be renamed something like "axial skeleton plus cranial skeleton"
