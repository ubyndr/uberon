## Abstract
...


We consider the autopod as consisting of 3 segments, divided according to the following jointly-exhaustive mutually-disjoint part-hierarchy, listed distal to proximal

  * `skeleton of autopod`    (aka 'autopod')
      * `skeleton of acropodium` (aka 'acropodium')
      * `metapodium skeleton`    (aka 'metapodium')
      * `mesopodium skeleton`    (aka 'mesopodium')

Note that in this document and in the ontology we currently use the unambiguous skeletal-prefixed terms, and phenoscape-preferred terms in parentheses.

Hoever, it is also possible to first group the acropodium and metapodium - confusingly, this is sometimes called the acropodium (e.g. Wagner and Chin 2001).
We accomodate this group, and introduce a new label 'digitopodium' (Ibrahim and Sereno) to group the proximal-most two elements

This gives us a second hierarchy (also part-wise JEPD):

  * `skeleton of autopod`    (aka 'autopod')
      * `skeleton of digitopodium` (aka 'digitopodium', 'acropodium (Wagner)')
          * `skeleton of acropodium` (aka 'acropodium')
          * `metapodium skeleton`    (aka 'metapodium')
      * `mesopodium skeleton`    (aka 'mesopodium')

This second hierarchy is consistent with the first, but includes an additional mereological sum for grouping purposes
