## Abstract
The neural crest workshop consists of a combination of domain experts with a variety of expertise (comparative neural crest anatomy, craniofacial, placodal, ENS/PNS, cell typing, etc) and ontologists. The outcome will be a much improved representation of neural crest amongst a number of ontologies including (but not limited to!) the Gene Ontology (GO), Uberon, the vertebrate musculosketal ontology (VAO), mouse anatomy (MA), the cell ontology, human developmental (EHDAA2/FMA), and the Teleost Anatomy Ontology (TAO). The hope is that the participants will form a new community around this work and author a paper together.
